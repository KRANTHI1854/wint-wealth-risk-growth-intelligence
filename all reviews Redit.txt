Wint Wealth
I recently came across this app which promises 11+% fixed return. I see that they have a lot of videos etc. also on YouTube about managing and increasing wealth. Anyone has used this app? What has been your experience?

The app is just a platform that helps you invest in bonds. It is similar to a brokerage app helping you invest in stocks.

They claim to have curated bonds and due diligence. Ultimately the risk is with the bonds and remains the same whether you invest through them or through any other means.

They do provide referral bonus etc as part of marketing

Using it for last 1.5 years. Invested some money. So far no issues.

Also, it’s a broker for bonds similar to Zerodha for stocks. They by themselves do not have your money but invest in underlying bonds.

I'm an avid user of the product! I have invested over 25 lakhs in the past 2 years in the platform. Absolutely recommend it.

The returns are legit. As others have mentioned, it is a broker for bonds. 

Moreover, it is backed by Zerodha. The Wint Wealth team themselves invests a part of the bonds issue size, signifying skin in the game. They carefully chooses which bonds to allow users to invest in.  So far, there haven't been any defaults made by their clients which is highly praise worthy. 

TLDR; Highly recommended!

How much returns are you receiving per month on 25 lakhs?

Novel_Television6068

Can't say exactly how much because I have invested in a bunch of different bonds. Some pay interest every 6 months, some quarterly, etc. But the XIRR that it shows on the profile is almost always above 10% because I only invest in bonds that give 10% or minimum Interest!

They have hand-picked a few bonds from the market and display them on their platform. They pick based on ratings, x collateral to bond, previous interest fulfillment, etc. The experience has been normal. Interests hit the bank based on what was shown before buying the bond. Have received principal at the time of maturity.

I can't say 100% whether they actually know what they are doing in terms of picking the 'less risky' bonds from the market. That is something you have to trust. Lock in double-digit YTM interest rates before companies start offering less due to repo rate revision.

I am currently using it and the experience has been very good so far. They have been one of the players in the bond market. They are sebi registered. All the bonds you buy will be moved into a demat account. So, tomorrow if wint wealth shuts shop, your investment will be safe.

Interest is paid monthly. I have received 4 payments so far. The bonds listed are curated and usually there will be only 10 to 12 bonds with a minimum credit rating of BBB.

But most of the bonds listed are of NBFCs. The risk is slightly lesser compared to equity, but don't think it is risk free.

If you are looking to invest in bonds, you can consider "grip investing" on Tata Neu as well. They are a direct competitor of Wint Wealth and they also curate the bonds on their platform. (I am using both btw).

I have been investing since the last 2 year, and invested 55 lakhs currently. I have a positive opinion for the short term, you can sell them any time and earn 10--12 % returns, which is pretty good. And you also get your principal back on a quarterly basis for some.

The platform is legit and customer service. But the bonds you buy at your own risk. I have been using for about 2 years and so far noone has defaulted. FDs can be booked direct with the banks, advantage is here you can see everything in one place

Buying bonds individually doesn't make sense to me, if you want a secure avenue then it's better to invest in a debt or conservative mutual funds.. They will take care of the buying and selling bonds, default risk etc.. Returns might be slightly low because of more investment in AAA bonds..

On the other hand, you buy a BBB bond and sure you will get decent returns, but the risk doesn't outweigh.. 1L in a single bond is different from 1L in a debt oriented MF.. And with the taxation , 30% of profits gone.. so, it would make more sense to invest in a debt oriented mutual fund which is a classified as equity orientated but actually more debt (Icici equity savings funds , PP dynamic asset fund etc) you will save tax and risk is voided..

I say do not trust any app, yt videos, influencers.

Use common sense, learn about investing or just stay away from the market because if you start without understanding, you will lose more.

I am not saying you need to take years, just a few weeks, check different companies, MF etc, understand impact, history, hidden charges etc.

You can even earn more than 11% but you need to understand. If you don't have time, better to go for FD, less return but safe.

Wint acts like a broker for buying and selling so I guess wint part of the equation is ok to invest ,you get them in your depository account. So the question is the credit risk, if the borrowers will default or not, even though the wint guys claim 0.0% default. I've invested the minimum amount of 10k across multiple bonds over the past few months to have a good spread across, and my first part of payment ever is in August.

I haven’t invested in it yet and do no intend to do so anytime in the near future but I am sure wint, as a company, is a legit company. It’s backed by the likes of Zerodha, Kunal shah, etc.

Earlier they used to offer coveted bonds, but after some RBI regulation they have now started offering senior secured bonds, which are safe but not as safe as covered bonds. Also, the IRRs that they offer are a bit underwhelming, and there are other companies in this space e.g. gripinvest (lease financing), LegalPay (litigation financing), KredX (invoice discounting), etc, that offer better IRRs.

Hit me up if you need any other information in the alternative investment space. I myself have invested in a couple of platforms and can share details if required.

Previously they were dealing with secured covered bonds i.e collateral is kept with a 3rd party and is used in case of a default but now due to new rules, they are doing senior secured bonds which is basically same but collateral is kept within their own books. I had previously invested 2lakhs and it went well.

Deviler4Fox

Returns are after all fees and charges except tax. Won't be exact interest % since some payments would be early and some would come later. This time value of money won't show up in simple interest formula but can use excel XIRR formula to verify returns.

Thanks for reply but I think they charge fees over return value means. If we invest 10k and getting 11k(10% xirr) in a year they add 400-500 charge for 10k which decrease return to 500-600(5-6%) am i right or I missed something

Wint wealth 2024 review?
Are you investing in bonds via wint wealth? Now that it has been here for a couple of years, I believe folks would have experiences to share and if they got interest rates that were actually promised. Any negative experiences? Would you recommend this for parking short term (1-2 yrs) funds via bonds over FDs (assuming I have the risk appetite for it)

Wint wealth is just a platform. It's safe. The bonds listed are at your own risk which are mostly safe on their platform as they pick good bonds only.

I have been investing in Wint Wealth regularly and overall I am happy with the experience.

If you have the risk appetite, you can explore investing since the bonds are Senior Secured, the overall safety is much higher.

Apart from Wint Wealth, I have also been investing in Senior Secured Bonds through Golden Pi platform however bonds there are not curated unlike ones in Wint Wealth so bit of research is required.

Bonds have tenure (you can say it is like a lock in).. Wint offers sell feature if you want to liquidate it before tenure finishes

Interest is paid directly to the bank account submitted during kyc

While I like wintwealth, only problem I have faced is if you are looking for medium to long term investment - these bonds have monthly or quarterly payouts. Payouts will come to your savings account and if you don't reinvest them again you will lose the compounding benefits.

One option is to set SIP on monthly cadence, to other corporate bonds of the similar nature (which will have lower XIRR) to get the compounding? But then the counter argument is why not invest in the corporate bonds based mutual funds itself in the first place? So on average you get lower interest but you will get compounding benefits even if you don't keep track of the things.

Long story short - if you are ready to take efforts then wintwealth like platform can give you higher returns but watch out for things mentioned above.

the corporate bonds in Zerodha for instance, give only about 8% returns, and also have an expense ratio. Wint wealth bonds have 11% XIRR and don't cost anything. So i think it is a good idea to invest into wint wealth bonds and rotate the interest in MF SIPs.

Ugro and Navi are good bonds that are live on Wint. Both are at 1K ticket.

Also as per Wint , Sebi is reducing ticket size of bonds to 10K shortly from 1L. Once that happens most of their bonds will start coming at 10K

Hi OP, love that you're bullish on bonds. There's another platform that you could try though, it is Stable Money. I work here :)

We recently launched bonds on the platform and have some solid options like Navi, Krazybee, and Muthoot, with YTMs going up to 12%. We currently only list senior secured bonds and haven’t had any defaults so far.

Would love for you to try it out and share any feedback on the experience, always looking to improve. Oh by the way, here's the number of the person who supervises Bonds at Stable Money, Arun. You can reach out to him for ANY concern regarding bonds at +91-9742497111

Ps: We're also big on FDs, feel free to check that out too!

On 5th June while purchasing a bond of 1 Lakh rupees from wint wealth app, the payment got approved and deducted, but wint wealth side it is showing as Order failed.

Upi transaction I'd: 5156516951.. Order I'd: 6861..

My upi Id has changed now since I uninstalled and removed my bank account from that app, although the upi number remains same. 

WhatsApp service: Response after 40mins on average after connecting to agent  Email Service: Mailed 3 days back, after automated ticket raised, no response yet. Phone Service: None of their 4 phone numbers mentioned on their website works, saying, incoming calls are not available.

Still haven't received my money after 3 days. They told to wait for 3-7 working days through WhatsApp. Don't know if my upi I'd will cause issue, but their main issue is customer service.

Good question! I've been watching Wint Wealth too. From what I've gathered from other users and my own research:

Positive aspects:

Interest payouts have generally been on time for most bonds

The platform interface is cleaner than some alternatives

Better yields than FDs in many cases (typically 8-10%+ depending on the bond)

Things to consider:

These are corporate bonds, so credit risk is a real concern. Even with ratings, defaults can happen (though rare with higher-rated bonds)

Liquidity can be an issue - unlike FDs, you can't always exit easily before maturity. The secondary market exists, but isn't always liquid

For a 1-2 year horizon, you might want to stick with AA+ or AAA-rated bonds to minimize risk

Returns aren't "guaranteed" like FDs - they depend on the issuer's financial health

My take: If you understand the credit risk and diversify across multiple issuers (don't put everything in one bond), it can work for short-term parking. But I'd personally keep at least some portion in FDs/liquid funds for true emergency access. Also, consider the tax implications - bond interest is taxed according to your tax slab, unlike some debt fund options.

Anyone else actively using it? Would love to hear recent experiences!

i already have a demat account with zerodha. While trying to invest in wint wealth for bonds, does it ask to create a demat account with wint wealth (an additional demat or merge with the existing demat account).

the reason is, we need to pay extra charges for maintaining multiple demat accounts ( I faced this in zerodha when having multiple demat accounts with zerodha and NJ India and Prabhudas Lilladar). Currently I have only zerodha.

Have used it recently to invest some cash which I just didn't want to commit to equity markets at this time (You can call me foolish for trying to time the market but keeping my equity exposure limited at present valuations just helps me sleep better).

Anyways, some inputs about them-

1/ They can make the website look a bit more appealing and a bit more informative. Not unhappy with the present website as such but it can definitely be made better (not going into detailed suggestions for now, happy to share if WintWealth team is here and looking for feedback).

2/ The product offerings till now have actually been able to impress me.

3/ Being a new start-up they are very responsive to customer queries. You will easily spot the founders working on your queries.

4/ Zerodha being one of their backers just makes me more confident. Read more here. BTW, they were earlier called GrowFix. So, if you want to search more about them then you can search with the old name too.

Personally, I feel they have the potential to grow massively. I haven't seen many attempts of democratizing debt investments for retail investors in past. I genuinely hope that they do succeed and do not become too adventurous with their offerings. The biggest threat to them in my opinion would be for one of the partner NBFC to go down and customers to face liquidity issues as a consequence. If they stick to clean NBFCs with healthy loan portfolios then I think they might be one of the next big things.

You can call me a fanboy but I was so impressed that I seriously considered pinging their founders to see if I could help them on their journey. Eventually, I didn't do that as my present job has been very rewarding for me and I want to contribute more here.

Wint Wealth is a sham!! They promise 10-11% returns but actually deliver 5-6%. The manipulation is, the principal amount on the bond is returned even before the tenure expires right in between, so the interest repayments that you get are peanuts. The only thing they are good at is to generate high costs in restructuring the investments and in the process they pocket the money on every small transaction

It is bankruptcy-remote with respect to the NCD issuer - the NBFC. The NCD is secured by the loans that the NBFC has financed. However, these loans are not on the NBFCs books anymore having been transferred to a SPV Trust. These loans are gold or vehicle loans - if they default or mature, then NBFC will top up security with other loans. If the NBFC goes bankrupt, you will then directly receive the loan payments via the SPV Trust - but I think here you take the risk that these underlying loans may default.

Apart from this security risk (which is mitigated a little but still attracts a high interest rate), there is liquidity risk also. You are buying privately placed NCDs in secondary market (not public issue). Usually most hold this to maturity but if you need to sell - you may not find a buyer.

Have been following them closely for a few months now- I think the effort they put into mitigating risk of loan default is commendable and the returns are decent too. Liquidity can be a concern (they do keep a certain percentage as liquidity reserve, but still). I’ve also found the team to be very responsive and happy to discuss products and doubts.

Zerodha featured them today :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmWQPFvA4HQ

Looks very good but somehow getting the feel of Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) like bubble in these which caused the '08 crisis. I know these are different but still my gut feels something drastic will happen in this after say 5-10 years when many retailers and banks invests in this.

I have invested in their product,as I cover all alternate investments on my blog randomdimes.com

I think the product is superior to bonds of similar issuers as selected loan receivables are put in an SPV managed by a trustee. They keep replacing receivables as they mature.

Normally NBFC issuer provide floating charge over assets which means you do not have a selected pool to recover default. In this case you get cashflow from pool incase a trigger event happen.

If borrower in pool default they can sell the collateral ,that i feel is tricky because of comingling of collateral, but still considering the yield its a decent product.

Coincidentally I was watching this video on CDOs. I am not totally sure how safe this is.

Notably, the crash of subprime mortgages in 2008 was because those mortgages were packaged into neat little CDOs like this, and resold. And when people could not pay, the crash brought down the whole finance system with it.

I am not sure how many people will default their vehicle loans, considering the COVID induced unemployment

Good, Simple, consider this as higher return FD with monthly payments but very illquid for buy/sell in secondary market, so you will have to hold it till maturity. Zerodha is an (and currently only) angle investor.

I think these are pretty secure and different then morgtgage backed securities. MBS were backed by housing loans and the house prices could drop like hell as they did in 2007-08. However, the value of vehicles, apart from depreciation, is not expected to collapse like that and should be pretty stable and deterministic. So, the bonds are actually covered for defaults. Although, if the calculations have been done correctly and collateral value not inflated is something that should be checked and I guess must be audited for most part.

Hey OP!

Always check for bonds to be Senior Secured. Only secured is not enough to protect capital. Senior secured gives 1st rank of repayment. I would also caution that there is always a 0.1% unknown risk - so nothing is 100% protected unless it is a DICGC backed FD till Rs 5,00,000.

Past record is no guarantee of future outcomes.

Also, I lead the bonds business at Stable Bonds.

If you or anyone is interested in exploring further, I'd be excited to introduce you to Stable Bonds, our new bond offering at Stable Money. We're focusing on providing a carefully selected set of high-quality, SEBI-regulated bonds (only A-rated or higher, nothing below that), ideal if you're newer to bond investing or looking for a straightforward, trusted experience. We’ve specifically designed our platform to address many of the common pain points investors face.

Happy to chat or answer any questions—feel free to DM me or drop an email at arun.rafi@stablemoney.in. Would genuinely love your thoughts if you give us a shot! Also here is the website stablebonds.in

Simple Answer: The higher the interest on any bond (compared to a PSU Bank deposit), the higher the uncertainty/ risk. I leave it to your imagination to decide how safe/ risky is a bond with an coupon of 10-11%.

Slightly technical answer: Covered bonds are complex, securitized instruments, somewhat like asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities. It is one thing for informed investors including institutional investors to invest in these. As for other investors, before even considering to investing in these bonds, at the very least, they need to be familiar with the concept and risks of securitization.

Too good to be true.

If someone is giving you 11% then they must be getting at least 13%, which is even riskier. What if those loans from NBFC don't come back? What if NBFC is defaulted? It will not be like a walk in the park to get your money back so easily. Collaterals need to be liquidated so so and so forth.... I am worried that I am getting ONLY positive side of the story here all over the internet. Especially its worrying to see people drooling over comments section on that P R Sundar's sponsored video (which he claims to be neutral). Personally I will not even put 50K INR into it (as of now) and 5,000 interest back doesn't really matter much.

Even i feel the same. Everyone here are praising it for its collateral and security,what about the interest part which it is paying, most of them seem to not concern about the nbfc's source of income to repay their interest amount.

Been using it for a few months now. Seems to be alright. Have a friend who bought one of the per month assets which credits interest every month. https://www.wintwealth.com/referral/?refId=5CBCA4 you can use this to get an extra 1% if you want

How reliable is Wint wealth/Stable money?!
Hey guys, it's been an year since I've started earning. My CTC is 9LPA, and I'm 25 years of age. Been investing in stock market for about an year now and have got 1.1L in portfolio. I've diversified my SIP in a couple of banks for 7K every month. Now I tend to invest in bonds via Wint Wealth/Stable money, to have some in the kitty of debt investments as well. So, just was curious if at all it's reliable and safe to invest in Navi/Krazybee bonds

Bonds aren't risk free. There have been defaults in the past and there will definitely be in the future as well. However, probability is low. Basis historical data, probability of default in A rated bonds is 1% which is fairly low. The call any investor would need to take is whether 2-4% extra returns compared to FDs (A rated bonds are giving 11% plus returns) justify the incremental risk or not.

Debt funds are preferable to direct bonds. Choose a debt fund category that aligns with your target timeline.

Wintwealth and stablemoney are good platforms, but investment in lower grade bonds is inherently risky. Higher grade bonds yield just 8%. You can get similar returns with corporate bond funds and pay tax only when you redeem.

People rarely understand risk. With these platform you take credit risk which is actually worse than market risk.

You as a retail should not credit risk at all. Plenty have burned their hands on this. Even institutions have burned their hands by not managing credit risk well

There are other funds that will give you similar returns with even safer risk level.

I think they are pretty reliable (plus invest less than 5 laksh).
If you are going for a FD, ensure that it is less than 5L .
I invest in Navi Bond's, so far I have been receiving the coupons. I think you can trust them.

Are Wint Wealth bonds safe and legit?
I've been seeing ads by WintWealth bonds, they promise higher returns on minimal investments. How true and safe is it? If you have tried it or some other bonds, I would like to hear from you. I can't invest more than 5k every month. Will that be sufficient for buying bonds? I'm new to the investment forte with absolutely zero finance knowledge.

Stick to basics. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Don't go for the flashy stuff, go for the dull stability, since you are starting out. Bonds can be junk too. Before putting money in this, see what the registered financial advisors (not the ransoms from YouTube or Instagram) have to say about this particular thing.

This is the best advice OP. If you are going into MF’s this is like the small cap fund. High risk but potential for a high return if multiple things go right all at the same time.

Or if you are looking for a Debt mutual fund, this is like a credit risk fund. Invest only the amount you can afford to loose.

I've been investing through wint wealth the last 3 years ... Touch wood all bonds have been paying interests in time ... and mature and close on time

My strategy buy- A and above rating bonds 10-11 % XIRR is a good bet spread ur investments across multiple bonds all of them won't go bust in worst case scenarios ...

If u hear anything negative of the bond sell it immediately, refund is genuine and quick

I have been invested in wint wealth bonds since 3 years and return would be 10-12% before TDS. There is no issues with payments till now. The investments in bonds depends on you risk profile , tenure and taxation. I would say bonds are better when you need to get interests monthly and if you are in lower tax bracket.

Quality of bond matters. Ex. Soverign Govt bond , AAA are rated very high and interest rate will be less. Lower rated bonds carry default risk and you may not get your money back, whether you buy from Wint or Goldenpi or Someother vendor.

Note : Even AAA like DHFL has defaulted in there past.

These rating agencies should be banned...All are bought.

These are bigger scams.

No rating can save you. Smart manipulators accumulated money and leave the country.

I too had some investments in Wint Capital Bonds (NBFC of Wint Wealth), I got the Annual Reports delivered and someone decoded it on the same subreddit and read this post.

Decided to sell holdings and put it into mutual funds. Like, the selling process was easy and the amount was credited within 3 hours, but I read on Wint's App that if there is any negativity around the NBFC, the selling option shall not be available.

Literally just writes off the senior secured claim by these platforms and some influencers.

It is such a shame that good influencers like Rahul Jain, Labour Law Advisor (LLA), and many platforms openly say that these are senior secured, whereas what the NBFCs offers is an excel sheet of their receivables, which might default and these NBFCs might die.

Yes, it's legit. But they have their own risks. So do your own due dilegence. I have been investing since 1 year and so far faced no issues.

Buy High Rated ones and you should be fine. Keep investment less than 5L(there is insurance).

In your case, you are beginner, ad can only do 5k with no knowledge. Stick to MF SIPs. idk your goals, so just assuming for long term.

The best credit rated companies in the market are borrowing at ~6.5%, so imagine the credit quality of a company which is ready to borrow at 11-12%.

For this kind of risk, you are better off investing in stocks, MFs. Atleast you'll have market liquidity to sell when you want to

The question you should be asking is what %age of your networth/total portfolio is going into this platform or asset class. If all goes down, can you sleep? If not, you have too much exposure.

You can't predict what will happen, you have to take risk - but measure the risk, and make sure you can live with it.

if u put 55k by the end of the year in a staggered manner even in a reputed bond (which this does not look like) then u will probably make 3% which is around 1500-2000 bucks . does it seem worth the risk? In your position, I'd rather buy niftybees.

I am early user of Wint and really like their customer support however since early 2025 I am finding the same bonds that Wint in selling priced better on other platforms. Most platforms do not charge brokerage but build commissions into the bond pricing. Wint pricing generally tends to the worst for investors lately.

Always google search the ISIN of the bond you are thinking of buying and check prices across platforms. Usually calling the platform team can get you additional discounts as well.

Reporting To SEBI: Wint App Possibly Committing Serious Fraud & Financial Crimes
TL;DR
1. Received substantially lesser payout for bond investment than what was promised in the Wint App.

2. After I enquired, Wint then changed the payout amount displayed in the app without informing me, and asked me to provide evidence or they would not investigate.

3. When I provided evidence, they gave 4 different reasons why it was changed.

4. Smells like brazen fraud, misleading advertisement, and unethical trade practice. Serious financial crimes.

I will be reporting this matter to SEBI, but I'm not sure yet how. I believe SCORES is one option.

Please let me know your suggestions on how to make sure this reaches the right person at SEBI and any other relevant authorities. TIA.

---

FULL POST:
1. On 6 Sep 2025, I invested ~5L in the corporate bond "Muthoottu Mini Gold Sep '25" via the Wint Wealth app. This bond has monthly interest repayments.

2. The first repayment, received on 1 Oct 2025, seems fine, but the following repayment on 1 Nov was significantly below the amount expected, as displayed in the Wint App:

Expected repayment displayed in the app (post-TDS) - ₹ 3915

Actual amount received (post-TDS) - ₹ 3528

Difference - ₹ 387

3. On 3 Nov, late in the night, I asked Wint support on whatsapp to let me know why there is such a large difference.

4. On 4 Nov, when I logged back into the Wint app in the morning, the figures shown for expected repayment had changed. Now it displayed the expected repayment post-TDS at Rs. 3528 (The actual amount received).

5. So I sent them a message saying, "yesterday it was showing post-TDS interest amount Rs. 3915 - the app has changed numbers now. This is extremely serious. Please let me know why the figures are being edited?"

6. The Wint team asked for a screenshot for proof that figures have changed, and I told them I had not taken any the day before. The team replied, "I kindly request you to share a screenshot next time so that I can raise it with the technical team accurately. I will be able to escalate only when I have the screenshot."

7. I knew what I had seen, so I replied, "This is a serious matter and the lack of a screenshot may be enough for you to close it, but for me it is not. I will now have to manually take screenshots, and compare all the payouts you have displayed in-app with the payouts received. The trust is gone. If you are not able to address why the figures in the app changed overnight, I will have to inform other Wint users. Please escalate this matter to the senior team." They did not escalate.

8. On 6 Nov, they shared daily pricing sheets for all my investments so I have a record of the expected repayments. The repayment figures in the sheets were the same as in the app after they had been changed.

9. Then, on 8 Nov, I received the following message from the Wint whatsapp bot:

Total amount credited: ₹ 3915.22

Here is a breakup of the amount credited:

• Interest amount (Pre-TDS): ₹4350.24

• TDS deducted: ₹435.02

• Date of payout: 1st November 2025

10. This was the smoking gun. I now had the evidence they needed, so I immediately shared the auto-generated message via whatsapp and asked them to investigate again.

11. They said, "3915 is the total amount from which 435 TDS was deducted. That brings the repayment amount to 3529." Anyone literate in Class 3 math knows this calculation is incorrect. 3915 - 435 = 3480, not 3529.

12. They sent this message at 6.30 pm, and their office closes at 7 pm so I couldn't reply in time. I had pointed this pattern out to them earlier, when they sent a message at 6.58 pm and logged off 2 mins later, after making me wait the whole day.

13. On 9 Nov, before I could reply that their calculations are wrong, they changed their statement and said, "the reason there is a difference in the amount is because you purchased the bond on 6th of september and not 1st of september. However, the message is a mistake from our end which we are working on rectifying." Then they tried to close the issue 30 mins later.

14. Before they could close it, I pointed out to them, "That might have affected the payment for October, but not for November. Your explanation doesn't make sense. Please escalate this issue and arrange a call from the senior team."

15. A while later, someone from the team called and said it's Sunday, the sernior team will look into it on Monday, 10 Nov. I messaged them again, "Please understand that this is a grave issue that has all the markings of misleading advertisement and fraud. The fact that your team was not willing to address the issue unless I shared a screenshot is very concerning. Now I have shared the evidence you wanted."

16. On 10 Nov, the team simply sent a message, "the amount you received is the correct amount, and it has now been updated on your dashboard as well. Apologies for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

No explanation given. Once again, they just wanted to close the issue. And by this point I had had enough. I realised Wint management is clearly not interested in addressing the matter. So I should just take this up with the authorities. I told them to send me their statement via email so I have a record of Wint giving at least 3 different reasons for the difference in repayment amounts, and 0 reasons for why their app changed the figures while I was not looking.

They sent the email and asked if I received it, so I replied, "Received, thanks. I will now have to refer this matter to SEBI for investigation as what is happening here seems to be serious fraud. I expected your team to take this seriously but you have not."

That, I think, is when it finally dawned on them that what is happening here may be serious. Within 20 mins, the Wint Head of Investor Relations called me to apologise, and offer a fourth and completely new explanation - "It was a system error. A glitch. Won't happen again."

This is, of course, meaningless. They've offered 4 different explanations now and I have no reason to believe any of them.

The facts remain:
1. Investments are made by users based on the interest calculations and repayment figures displayed in the app.

2. When I raised the extremely serious issue that the app is changing figures after investment, it was summarily closed without any deeper investigation simply because I could not provide a screenshot for evidence.

3. After I provided evidence, Wint admitted they are changing the figures. Until then, they provided multiple incoherent justifications for the substantial difference in interest amounts.

4. Despite multiple requests to have this escalated to the senior team, their WhatsApp support just kept closing the issue.

---

I told them many times this is a grave issue. Changing the figures after the investment has been made, and not delivering the promised repayment is brazen fraud, misleading advertisement, and unethical trade practice.

I don't know how many times they have done this before. I don't have screenshots from the days I invested.

Wint management was clearly not interested in addressing the matter, and these are potentially serious financial crimes that need to be reported to SEBI for investigation.

I expected Wint to take this issue seriously. Famous names and photographs are prominently displayed on their website as Wint backers and investors, including Nikhil Kamath (Zerodha), Kunal Shah (Cred), Pravin Jadhav (PayTM Money), Lalit Keshre (Groww), Vaibhav Domkundwar, and many others. These names and photos are placed there to build credibility and trust, and show capability.

But this is incredibly unsettling.

By their own admission, Wint is at best criminally incompetent, and at worst completely fraudulent. I'm deeply concerned now about my considerable money that they're handling, and several other people I have referred to the platform who have invested large amounts.

Yes, that happened to me too for other bonds. I've received +/- Rs. 2 from the expected amount. I chalked it down to a percentage calculation margin of error.

This time the difference is ~10% of the expected payout. That is not a margin of error.

How do the payouts work? Are they routed through Wint? I mean afaik, the bond issuer directly credits interest into the bank account linked to the demat in which you are holding the bonds?

Even if App reports incorrect payout, you will receive reoayment directly from BOND issuing company, i beleive Wint Wealth has no control on monthly payout. They can only control the absolute price at which Bond is sold.

Check the coupon rate.

Check if the yearly returns (including TDS) matches the coupon rate.

Nothing else matters. Wint doesn't control the interest given out by companies you put money in. The company transfers the amount directly to your account after cutting TDS.

The questions are -

Does wint wealth get a percentage of the transaction value from the issuer of the bond?

If yes to Q1, does showing a higher than reality fake return lead to people subscribing to the bond more thereby leading to more income of wint wealth?

If Q1 and Q2 are right, does wint wealth showing higher returns than what is the reality constitute fraud?

Just to add, in point 11 : 3915 is the total amount from which 435 TDS was deducted. Why would 435 be deducted? TDS is generally at 10% in most places, so ₹391.5 should’ve been debited. Here it’s 11.11%.

I’d also recommend getting a screenshot of the repayment of the same bond from another Wint Wealth user and maybe from another platform. You can also calculate your own repayment based on the coupon rate and price at which you bought the bond.

I feel these 2 points will strengthen your case against Wint to SEBI.

I had a similar incident with the Cred app as well. They silently increased the loan emi like 50rs above the expected. I realised when I reviewed the repayment schedule which i saved as screenshot. These apps are not trustworthy.

This isn't tolerable; this is outright daylight robbery. Submit a complaint on SCORES with all the evidence and let the regulator summon them. As investors, we trust platforms like Wint to help us by being accountable for their actions, rather they're dodging us when serious concerns are flagged. But most importantly, before submitting a complaint to SCORES, drop an email to their grievance redressal one last time and see if they accept it. If they are also not supportive, go ahead with complaining to the regulator. Mention the bond issuer and Wint both.

Edit: @ajinkya_wint I just saw the emails from Wint in my inbox and they're partially or fully AI-generated. I hope your internal calculations aren't also using LLMs..

Also, @ajinkya_wint if you actually see this, can you provide an overview of what regulatory scrutiny and compliances Wint comes under?

This is Ajinkya, CEO of Wint Wealth.

Got the download of exactly what happened with your case from the team.

Before trying to explain what happened let me just start by apologising for the poor experience.

The miss from our team was regarding the amount displayed to be repaid after TDS deduction.

I got it checked whether you received amount less than what would justify the return promised on the page of investment in that particular bond- that is not the case.

The calculation displayed in our app was inaccurate which led to the confusion from your end. The return displayed for this particular bond will not be affected by this inaccuracy.

Since you raised it, team checked if others faced the same issue- and found that 7 other users faced this same technical glitch ir mistake from our end- we proactively reached out to them explaining what happened, including you.

Like someone else pointed out here- we don’t process your repayment or hold your investment as a platform in any shape or form. Regardless, we pride ourselves in being the most transparent platform. I am reviewing processes to make sure such mistakes don't happen in future .

Again, I genuinely apologise for the inconvenience this has caused you.

I have already pinged you on WhatsApp to check if there is any pending issue.

Thanks,

Good on you for the reply. But what does “The calculation displayed in our app was inaccurate” mean?

Does that mean all users need to manually calculate something just to make sure? Or better yet, how can an inaccurate calculation be displayed?

Reviews for Wint wealth.
I have some amount to invest (around ₹100k to ₹150k) and I came across wint wealth.Their returns seem to be good around 9-11 percent and I am confused as to whether I should invest in their bonds or is it too unsafe? Anyone of you please share your experience with this platform.Thanks

Hey OP! Wint has certainly helped popularize bond investing. With bonds, especially corporate ones, safety primarily hinges on ratings and issuer credibility. It's not inherently unsafe, but choosing bonds carefully is essential.

At Stable Money, where I lead the bonds business, we've launched "Stable Bonds" with a focus on safety and ease, especially if you're new to bond investing. We only offer bonds rated "A" or higher—no BBB-rated bonds at all—and have some really interesting picks including bonds from well-known companies and even government-issued bonds like GOI and Telangana. It’s structured specifically to help first-time investors gain comfort and confidence.

I'd be super excited if you gave it a shot. Feel free to DM me directly, or you can reach me at arun.rafi@stablemoney.in. Would love to chat or guide you personally!

Here's our website stablebonds.in incase you want to explore without downloading the app.

Directly investing in bonds is similar to directly investing in equity, in a way that you have to evaluate the underlying company.

Bonds issued by gov are safe as gov can print as much money. But corporate bonds on the other hand, depends on the company, if the company goes under you will loose that amount. And since a single bond unit is expensive it’s difficult for retail investors to buy multiple bonds and diversify their portfolio, so it is better to buy units in Debt Funds if you want to invest in debt assets.

As for the platform am not really sure.

Can someone guide from their experience around how Bond Market is good to invest? Also, how wint wealth is? TBH 11% returns seems lucrative comparing to FDs.

As a platform it’s a credible platform, I have invested in bonds through them. But what i don’t like is TDS deduction from their side and no way to tell them not to do that! There’s another platform called stable bonds, they don’t charge brokerage on transaction but only buying option is available right now in their platform. Hope this helps

In Wint wealth, does it allow you to instantly sell the bond if you want to? I think they do not allow so and you have to get in touch with their team, is that correct?

Some zero tds bonds have started to come. As more NBFCs become compliant to recent tax changes, more NBFCs should move to zero tds if your bond purchase is of less a 10K interest

While 11% seems very lucrative, please also factor the risk involved… usually when any institution is giving you such a high interest, they lend it to more risky profiles… always remember that the whole principal amount can be at risk if the issuer defaults… i would recommend investing in MF’s that does this jobs for you… also something like DAAF or equity savings fund could be a better alternative if we factor taxation as well

Top mutual funds for long-term growth
Investing in mutual funds for long-term growth requires careful consideration and strategic planning. Here are some of the top mutual funds recommended by Redditors for long-term growth, categorized by their investment focus and risk levels.

Index Funds
Index funds are often recommended for their low costs and broad market exposure.

Nifty 50 / Nifty Next 50: These funds track the performance of the top Indian companies. "N50, NN50 and midcap 150. If you need more kick then Nifty small cap 250. Invest into them like 35:25:25:15."

S&P 500 Index Funds: For international diversification, investing in the S&P 500 can be a solid choice. "Kung growth try mo yung US Equity Index Feedrr Fund Class P kung peso or Class A for USD. Tina-track nito yung S&P500"

Flexi Cap Funds
Flexi cap funds invest across market capitalizations, providing diversification and the potential for higher returns.

Parag Parikh Flexi Cap: This fund is highly recommended for its balanced approach. "Parag Parikh Flexi Cap and an index are solid core choices for a 15–20 yr SIP."

HDFC Flexi Cap: Another solid option for broad market exposure. "Follow this if it’s bit aggressive portfolio: Nippon India Nifty50 ETF, HDFC/Motilal Oswal/invesco mid cap, Parag Parekh/HDFC/JM Flexi cap, Nippon/bandhan small cap, SBI gold ETF"

Mid Cap Funds
Mid cap funds invest in companies with medium market capitalizations, offering a balance between growth and stability.

Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund: Recommended for its potential for higher returns. "MO Midcap and Quant small cap, its like playing cards with investor money."

HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities Fund: A good choice for aggressive growth. "HDFC/Motilal Oswal/invesco mid cap"

Small Cap Funds
Small cap funds invest in companies with small market capitalizations, which can be more volatile but offer higher growth potential.

Nippon India Small Cap Fund: Known for its aggressive growth potential. "Nippon India / Quant Small Cap"

HDFC Small Cap Equity: Another highly recommended small cap fund. "HDFC small cap equity"

Aggressive Growth Funds
For those with a higher risk appetite, aggressive growth funds can offer significant returns.

SCHG (Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF): This ETF focuses on large-cap growth stocks. "SCHG"

VGT (Vanguard Information Technology ETF): Invests in technology companies, which have shown strong growth. "VGT for growth. Look up the returns"

Balanced and Hybrid Funds
For a more conservative approach, balanced or hybrid funds can provide a mix of equities and debt.

ALFM Global Multi-Asset Income Fund: Offers monthly dividends and potential appreciation. "ALFM GLOBAL MULTI-ASSET INCOME FUND - PHP CLASS"

Aggressive Hybrid Funds: These funds invest in a mix of equities and debt, providing a balance between growth and stability. "Long term focused, yet moderate to high risk, then consider two aggressive hybrid funds."

Additional Tips
Diversification: It's crucial to diversify your investments across different types of funds and market capitalizations. "Consider splitting 15L into 3 parts of 5L each. 5L for nifty50, 5L for s&p500, 5L: 1L gold, 1L silver, 1L equity (mid-cap), keep the other 2L to buy the DIPs within the next 6 months."

Regular Review: Monitor your fund's performance regularly and adjust your portfolio as needed. "Study the Fund’s fact sheet every quarter and see if your mix needs any churn once a year."

Consult a Financial Advisor: For personalized advice, consider consulting a SEBI Certified Investment Advisor. "Hire a SEBI Certified Investment Advisor."

Why I'm worried about Wint Wealth's new bonds
I was checking out Wint Wealth’s Wint Capital bonds at 11.75%. At first glance it sounded decent. But when I actually looked at the company’s financials (they’re rated BBB-), it really didn’t add up for me. Sharing what I found, would love to know what others think.

Quick facts I noticed:

The company is still making losses (even in the latest quarter).

Debt has jumped like crazy: from 1x to over 5x in just 2 years. Basically, they’re borrowing a lot more than before.

Their safety cushion (capital adequacy) has dropped from ~50% to ~21%, which is close to RBI’s minimum.

A big chunk (42%+) of their loans are to just 10 borrowers. If even 1-2 of them default, it’s a problem.

They lend mostly to other small/unrated finance companies, which are riskier by nature.

65% of their funding is from NCDs sold via Wint Wealth. If fresh investors stop putting money, how do they repay old ones?

Why I’m uneasy:

With such thin profits, they can’t lend to top-quality borrowers, so they’re stuck with riskier ones.

Heavy borrowing = less margin for error.

Reliance on constant new inflows feels like a treadmill.

The return doesn’t match the risk:

Usually, BBB- rated companies in India offer 14–18% interest to attract investors.

Akara Capital (BBB) pays ~15–16%.

Keertana (BBB+) ~14%.

RDC Concrete (BBB+) >14%.

Kinara/TruCap (BBB/BBB-) were at 15% before they eventually defaulted.

But Wint Capital is offering only 11.75%. Basically you’re taking the same risk, but getting paid much less.

I actually like Wint’s concept and I’ve been following them for a while, but this particular deal feels off. I don’t mind taking risk if I’m paid properly for it but here it just feels like the downside risk is way bigger than the upside.

Maybe I’m overthinking it, so would love to hear from any finance experts around. Has anyone here actually invested in these Wint Capital bonds? Am I missing something important, or does this look misleading to you too?

(Mods: happy to DM or share links to the financial statements I found if that helps keep the discussion factual.)

I really don't understand the appeal of buying individual bonds. Debt funds give you diversification, liquidity and differed taxation. Sure, maybe you'll earn marginally more with bonds. But why are you trying to increase the risk and returns in the fixed income part of your portfolio?

Do not chase returns with your fixed income portfolio. Remember "return of capital" is more important than "return on capital"

Stay safe with fixed income side and take risks on liquid equity side. These ncds will not be liquid and once they default, you are screwed..

Never invest in bonds with BBB +/- Ratings. They are inherently very risky. Do not do it on any platforms. Also as you said the coupon rate is only 11.75 which is very less for these types of bonds. If you want to take risk then go the mutual fund route and invest in Credit Risk funds. They provide even more high returns and there are big fund houses which provide it but do your due diligence before investing there as well.

I was wondering the same thing. Especially with the statement they advertise that they are investing 2% of “their own money” in the bonds shortlisted on their platform.

Well many invest through this platforms...coz they don't know how to directly invest in those high interest rate BBB bonds, else they would push wint to the side and jump on those directly.

Another thing is....many are not aware of bonds vs equity and the perks and risks they hold....people just want to earn money....they read bond as safe investment......bond issuers ....issue bonds on high rates thinking people will buy becoz people have this mindset that bonds are safer than equity.

One needs to learn that bonds are not safe inherently they are safe because one decides to invest in low interest yielding bonds and risk of them going bust is minimal but not zero( incase of IIFL & DHFL).

Better to let money stay in savings account with very low interest yielding which is actually more safer than corporate bonds.

It's like ( interms of more safest to least safe)

1.SB account - safest( not safe if bank goes bust)

2. Government Bonds

3. Corporate low yielding bonds

4. Corporate High yielding bonds

Same here. Having invested for over 3-4 years in many one thing we must appreciate is there haven't been any defaults so far. So Wint seems to have better diligence than IndMoney or GoldenPi etc. I personally believe them to be a much better platform than most others.

Problem areas though (mostly these are common on any bond platform)

Many retailers don't understand ratings and buy blindly. Senior secured/unsecured? What's the collateral? No idea.

Yields for retailers is a stupid concept. It's just a number no one can hit due to lack of capital and opportunities. Coupon rates are 1-2% lower. Really it's a misrepresentation, that's legally mandated.

Taxation is another aspect. Bought at premium? Bought at discount? Both have different treatments.

With the influx of retailers now the conf calls seem to have no representation and mostly investors are missing on penalty payments (2%) because no one votes or shows up in calls. This means in many of those issues people don't even bother to claim their right and everyone loses except companies.

Many of the times investors have no idea what the trustee communication means. And not voting is the same as acceptance so companies prefer this mode as they're not getting asked tough questions.

Returns could be lower than credit risk funds for relatively the same risk on security and for something that is not professionally managed.

Bonds are in their own untouchable demat account so even if you wanted to play it smart and sell it in open market, you'll have a difficult time managing that.

I think I need to clarify for some people, OP is talking about the Wint Capital issuer not the Wint platform….Wint platform has safer bonds with decent returns that are worth exploring…the risky investment are binds issued by Wint Capital that are available for subscription on the Wint platform

Wint is just a middleman. You decide if the bond is worth the risk-reward. Has someone invested has no meaning. That's like saying you buy Wipro today just because somebody bought it in 1980s and made lot of money. Pointless.

I will not use Wint or any other similar pfs due to the risks involved in NCDs. Read about DHFL (AAA NCD)

Based on the investment horizon & amount required, allocate your portfolio across a mix of liquid fund, short-term debt fund, INVIT, arbitrage fund, equity-savings fund, bank fd & conservative hybrid fund (as needed, depending upon the overall corpus).

Set up a SWP from the liquid fund & periodically replenish it using the other components mentioned, so that the SWP amount is always maintained.

My opinion:
I’d avoid using bonds for passive income and would rather invest in REITs and InvITs. Even though their distributions are taxed, the potential for capital appreciation can better offset the tax impact compared to bonds.

Very poor support services, if you get your money on time then it's fine, if somehow it is stuck then it is very risky. I have invested a very huge amount, but my FD investment stuck and it took a lot of time to recover. I'm now reducing my money with them. Not recommended with good money.

I have been investigating with them for 2 years now.

My review:

These are senior secured bonds - basically backed by some kind of asset and would get paid first as it's a senior debt.

They bring nbfc bonds which constantly need money to give out loans, some good nbfc bonds I have found are IIFL, Muthoot and Navi.

Their support and youtube channel are really great.

Overall I'd recommend it, but one should do their own research.

There's some liquidity issues if you try and withdraw more than 3 lacs from what I read. Basically, when you sell your holding they need to find another buyer for it

Anyone more knowledgeable may please elaborate on this

They claim to settle more than 2200 cr. And still never heard of! That makes me little doubtful. 11% return is just never heard of!

Wint wealth experience? Recommend or No?
I opened Wint wealth website to check ehat exactly it offers turns out they offering Private Company Bonds. The website doesn't provide much info but pushes to download it's app and when I read it's review I found some critical reviews which speaks about

Horrible Customer service and that too apparently it redirects to WhatsApp with slow reply.

No buyers if you want to sell your Bond.

High brokerage

Buggy app

There is no proper information about how much Tax will be deducted. Please share your experience and also are there any other Alternatives to it. Thank you for your Inputs in advance.

Using WintWealth for 6 months, Here are my reviews:

Customer support is bad. It takes 3-4 hours to get connected but they provide the needed help once u are connected.

Sold 2 bolds mid cycle just to check the selling experience, one got sold off the next day. Another one took around 3-4 days maybe due to weekends in between.

Brokerage is around .25% which is fine considering the amount of vetting and easy experience they provide although it feels a bit too much at times also they provide their demat account for free. They do have 0 brokerage events every 1-2 months. I have missed those though. Another alternative is StableMoney bonds which is pretty new but I don't trust their vetting process much. The YTM you see is post brokerage.

Haven't felt the app is buggy till now.

Edit: The bonds returns are taxed at slab rate but if you sell the bonds then STCG and LTCG comes into play depending if it's listed or unlisted bond. Any STCG is taxed on your income tax level and LTCG is on 12.5%

Second this.

Invested a small bit sometime back and there are issues(albeit small) with repayments. Contacted customer care and it took them over 3 hours to assign an agent to chat over WhatsApp.

Then, once assigned it was pushed to a couple days later only to be told- "The actual repayment is made directly by the issuing entity, and due to compliance restrictions, they do not share investor specific repayment data with us."

So there's that!

Invest only what you're ready to awry is what I'd suggest.

Here a bad experience not from a investing perspective BUT some query resolution...

I am a financial planner and wanted to offer Debt related investments to my clients who themselves were willing to take some risk. This is after portfolio diversification. I tried to reach out to WintWealth to ask if they recruited agents/distributors, for which i gave them my mobile number on the official whatsapp channel. They kept insisting for my email id, which i never understood...I have given them a mobile number which is a direct access to me why ask for email. They told me unless you give email id we cannot help...Answer was very simple " We do not provide distributorship." end of story.

CFP here, if you are not an HNI, buy bonds through Mutual funds rather than going for specific issue. Also debt really isnt an attractive option right now given the rise in credit risk

Some bonds look attractive with more than 11% YTM,but mutual funds average about 9%. I know the ratings may be on negative side , but if I have a risk appetite isnt it wise to invest in them directly?

Hi can anyone explain how does the whole concept of buying bonds work like do you pay a lump sum amount at the starting and they pay you back monthly installments or or the other i.e you pay monthly installments and get lump sum at the time of maturity

Read about corporate bonds a little bit more and than you can try Wint wealth. This is a good platform. I have been using this for the past few months. Customer service is excellent over email.
