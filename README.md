## Executive Overview

This repository presents a structured intelligence program designed to evaluate customer perception, operational friction, trust sensitivity, and growth risk signals using large-scale public feedback data.

The objective of this project was not basic sentiment reporting.

The objective was strategic risk interpretation and business-impact translation.

Using multi-year public customer signals, this project transforms unstructured narratives into measurable executive-level insights.

This dashboard visualizes:

* Overall sentiment distribution
* Year-wise negative spikes
* Positive vs neutral vs negative evolution
* Signal clustering intensity

Executive Insight: Negative sentiment is episodic, not structurally rising.

Key Finding: Dominant fear is financial uncertainty — not product failure.

---

## Sentiment Evolution

Trend modeling indicates:

* Historical improvement in positive sentiment
* A peak approximately 7 months prior

# 🚨 Critical Operational Observation – OTP Onboarding Delay

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/otp_delay.png" width="900">
</p>

During fresh installation testing, OTP delivery delays exceeding 4–5 minutes were observed.

In financial platforms, authentication is the first trust checkpoint.

Business Risk Implication:

* Install-to-registration drop-offs
* Reduced funded account conversion
* Early-stage perception damage

In finance:
The first 60 seconds shape long-term confidence.

---

## Business Risk Diagnostics

Customer signals were consolidated into four primary business exposure dimensions:

### Growth Risk

Early-stage onboarding friction may reduce activation velocity.

### Revenue Risk

Liquidity uncertainty may influence reinvestment behavior.

### Trust Risk

Perception gaps amplify narrative sensitivity.

### Operational Risk

Support mentions indicate potential scalability pressure.

---

## Strategic Recommendations (Business-Feasible)

1. Contextual default transparency with comparative benchmarks
2. Publish historical liquidity behavior metrics
3. Introduce macro-triggered structured risk communication
4. Implement risk-sensitive support prioritization
5. Strengthen institutional trust signaling within UI

These adjustments enhance confidence durability without product redesign.
